a simple firefox extension that redirects beatleader.net to .xyz

probably not compatible with custom leaderboard contexts such as scpm

this extension is shit and would be way nicer if there was a way to choose between redirecting to .net or .xyz
unfortunately im not a browser extension guru so feel free to make your own ig xdd
